1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the responses to these statements. The program doesn't which word is the key word and there fore provides a response that may not make any sense.

When there is more than one keyword included in another word they program responds to the keywords that appears first in the sequence of if statements. And if there is more than one keyword, this becomes a problem because the word that appears first may not be the main subject of the sentence leading to a silly response.
